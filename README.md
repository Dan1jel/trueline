# Trueline: Bash Powerline Style Prompt with True Color Support

Trueline is a fast and extensible [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline)
style bash prompt with true color (24-bit) and fancy glyph support.

The pure Bash code implementation and overall features are modelled after the excellent
[Pureline](https://github.com/chris-marsh/pureline) command prompt project. However
Trueline also adds the ability to use RGB color codes, expands icon/glyph usage across
prompt segments (inspired by [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k))
and, among other goodies, shows the current input mode (when in vi-mode).
